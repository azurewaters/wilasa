Only a hundred and thirty-four spacious apartments occupy the nearly five acre plot. With greenery all around — inside and outside your home — Wilasa gives you room to breathe, and indeed, revel in. </p> </section> <section class="pictureHolder"> <img src="aerialShot.1823d8f9.png" alt="Aerial shot of Wilasa"> </section> <section class="topicSection" id="theWilasaLife"> <span class="heading">The Wilasa Life</span> <p> We take pride in the greenery in Wilasa. Every home either has a garden or looks out onto one. The common areas host large swathes of green, landscaped gardens, giving us a sense of living amidst nature </p> <p> The houses are between 2,000 and 4,000 sq. ft. in size, with either 3 or 4 bedrooms each. There's room enough in each of them to stretch your legs out, and also work without distractions. </p> <p> Wilasa has all the amenities that high-rise apartments offer, including a luxurious club-house, a well-equipped gym, a beautiful swimming pool, and 24-hour security and maintenance. However, each block rises only about 50 feet, and affords you almost the same amount of privacy that an individual home can offer. Thus, Wilasa strikes a balance between apartment living and individual-home living. </p> </section> <section id="video" class="topicSection"> <span class="heading">Video</span> <p>Here is a video walkthrough of the entire property.</p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mRIAUEUzYCs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </section> <section class="topicSection" id="otherFeatures"> <span class="heading">Other Features</span> <ul> <li> All vehicular traffic in Wilasa is underground, freeing up the area above for walks, play and community. </li> <li> Wilasa is located a 100 metres from the nearest metro station, a couple of hundred metres from a top-notch hospital, a few hundred metres from schools like Kumaran's and a couple of kilometres from Delhi Public School and The Valley School.
